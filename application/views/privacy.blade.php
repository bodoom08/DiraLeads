            application can be recognized as unique the next time you access, visit, use, or otherwise take advantage of the Services or other media.
            Cookies may also reflect demographic data pertaining to you or other data linked to the information you submit. One use or consequence of
            cookies is to enable you to receive customized ads, alerts, content, services, or information. You are always free to decline any cookies
            we use by adjusting the settings of your browser, as your browser may permit; however, some products, services, or features might not be

        <p>In addition, we, our service providers, and others sometimes use data-gathering mechanisms on the Services, including without limitation
            “web beacons”, “clear GIFs”, “pixels” and/or “tags”. These perform statistical and administrative functions, such as measuring site and

            (such as information relating to a particular browser, device or IP address) and positioning images, and typically do so without detracting
            from your online experience. Such mechanisms are not necessarily designed to collect Personal Information. In addition, if you have
            provided your email address, we might use a non-human unreadable form (or “hash”) of your email address to deliver, or facilitate the
            delivery of, relevant advertisements and information to you on
