                    The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the
                    Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the website infringe
                    your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that we remove the material or block access to it. If you believe in
                    good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice
                    after we have removed the material. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See
                    <a href="#"> http://www.copyright.gov/. </a>Notices and counter-notices should be sent to the Company’s Designated Copyright Agent at:<br>
                    info@diraleads.com<br>
                    Please note that under the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing or was removed
                    or disabled by mistake may be subject to liability.
